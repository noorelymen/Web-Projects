/*

Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough 
money and must receive only his stated salary.
Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" 

Exemple : 
salaryWithBonus(100, true) //=> 1000£
salaryWithBonus(30, false) //=> 30£

/*

The company you work for has just been awarded a contract to build a payment gateway. In order to help move things along, 
you have volunteered to create a function that will take a float and return the amount formatting in dollars and cents.

39.99 becomes $39.99

The rest of your team will make sure that the argument is sanitized before being passed to your function although you will 
need to account for adding trailing zeros if they are missing (though you won't have to worry about a dangling period).

Examples:

3 needs to become $3.00

3.1 needs to become $3.10

/*

Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table for 5 looks like below:

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50

P. S. You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end.

/*

Write a function to convert a name into initials. The name will be two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

Exemple :

initials("Moussaoui","Akram") // => M.A

Sam Harris => S.H

Patrick Feeney => P.F

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
